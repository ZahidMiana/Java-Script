/*  "let const and var ki kahani" 
1:constant=>  which cannot change  
2:var=> Prefer not to use because of issue in block scope and function scope
3:Difference between var and let
var: Due to its function scope and potential for hoisting-related bugs, var is less commonly used in modern JavaScript development. Itâ€™s generally recommended to avoid var in favor of let or const unless you need specific behavior associated with var.
let: Preferred for variables that need to be reassigned but are limited to a block scope, making the code more predictable and less prone to errors.
