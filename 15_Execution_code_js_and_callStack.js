
/*he execution context in JavaScript is a fundamental concept that defines the environment in which code is evaluated and executed. It includes the scope, variables, this keyword, and the order in which the code is run. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Types of Execution Contexts
Global Execution Context (GEC):

This is the default context where your entire JavaScript code runs. When a JavaScript file is first loaded in the browser or Node.js, a global execution context is created.
It creates a global object (e.g., window in browsers or global in Node.js) and binds this to that object.
All global variables and functions are defined in this context.
Function Execution Context (FEC):

Every time a function is invoked, a new function execution context is created.
Each function has its own execution context, which is separate from the global context or other function contexts.
This context manages the function's local variables, arguments, and the value of this within that function.
Eval Execution Context:

When the eval() function is executed, it creates an execution context to evaluate the code inside eval.
2. Phases of Execution Context
Creation Phase:

When a context is created, JavaScript goes through a creation phase before it starts executing the code.
Global Context Creation:
The global object (window or global) is created.
this is bound to the global object.
Variables, functions, and objects are created in memory but are not yet assigned any values. Functions are hoisted (their declarations are moved to the top), and variables are hoisted (but they are initialized to undefined).
Function Context Creation:
A function’s arguments are created and initialized with the values passed during the call.
Local variables and functions inside the function are hoisted.
The this keyword is set according to the function’s context (e.g., determined by how the function is called).
The creation of a lexical environment that contains all local variables.
Execution Phase:

JavaScript executes the code line by line.
The variables and functions that were hoisted in the creation phase are now assigned their values.
Code within functions, loops, and conditionals runs during this phase.
3. Components of Execution Context
Variable Object (VO) / Lexical Environment (LE):

The variable object contains all variables, function declarations, and arguments for the context.
In ES6 and beyond, the variable object is replaced by the lexical environment, which has two parts:
Environment Record: This is where variable and function declarations are stored.
Outer Environment Reference: It points to the lexical environment of its parent context, enabling scope chain resolution.
Scope Chain:

The scope chain is used to resolve variables. It consists of the current lexical environment and its parent environments.
If a variable is not found in the current scope, JavaScript will look for it in the outer scope until it reaches the global scope.
this Binding:

The value of this is determined by how a function is called.
In the global context, this refers to the global object.
In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method.
In a function, this can refer to the global object (in non-strict mode) or undefined (in strict mode). */
